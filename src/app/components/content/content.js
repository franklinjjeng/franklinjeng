  aboutMe: {
    summary: `I'm a full stack software engineer and I have found that this is my passion.
            With my enjoyment of puzzles and my desire to perform technical work, software engineer suits me perfectly as it sits right at the cross section of the two.
            The boundless field constantly offers something new to learn and tackle, allowing me to stay engaged.`,
    history: `I graduated from the University of California, Irvine as a Computer Engineer.
            Shortly after I found my first job as a VoIP engineer, diagnosing and troubleshooting voice quality issues in client environments.
            The natural career path progression brings you to a business oriented role where I became a Technical Account Manager.
            After two years, I realized that I lost my feeling of fulfillment that I used to receive when I would be the one solving technical issues.
            I explored coding courses online and I immediately fell back in love with it.
            I decided to quit my job and move back to the bay area to re-learn coding and become a software engineer.`,
    future: `Currently, I’m looking for somewhere I can make a meaningful impact while simultaneously grow as an engineer.
            Though I am most comfortable with Javascript,
            I’m confident in my abilities to learn new languages.`,
    interests: {
      puzzles: `I enjoy puzzles of all kinds. Ranging from physical, like rock
              climbing to determine the correct path and moves to take, to
              mental, like riddles and logic puzzles. The satisfaction you get
              once you figure something out is an amazing feeling. The desire to
              push forward and continue attempting it is fueled by the
              frustration of not being able to solve it.`,
      music: `Music is incredibly therapeutic and has something for every kind
              of mood. Small or large accomplishments are best accompanied with
              a victory dance. A night out dancing with friends is always an
              enjoyable one. No music around you? I’d like to make my own music
              with drums and would love to relearn the instruments I learn to
              play as a child to make more. And while I’m not the best at
              singing, my main stages have been my car and the shower.`,
      travel: `I’d love to explore the world as much as I possibly can to see
              what's around us. I’ve made my way international a couple times,
              but I definitely want to continue doing so.`

  homeBlurb: `Hi there!
              I'm Franklin and this is a collection of things put together.
              A snippet of my personal life and to showcase my technical prowess.
              This site is somewhat a digital playground. 
              Everything is built from scratch without the use of WYSIWYG websites utilizing React as its front end framework.
              It also allows me to practice my front end design such as 'responsive web design' and 'parallax scrolling'.
              In fact, this home page layout was designed specifically for responsive web design.
              Go ahead and resize the window!`
